Config files I use. Most of them are saved as dotfiles. Copy or symlink them to your home directory.

## Install Linux

Copy and paste this into the terminal to install:

```bash
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eirikff/config/master/linux/install.sh)
```

**Note:** Install script onyl tested on Ubuntu

All other files are independent of system
